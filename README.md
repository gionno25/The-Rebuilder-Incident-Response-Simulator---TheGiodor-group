# The Rebuilder: Incident Response-Simulator - TheGiodor-group
This repository contains the game produced by TheGiodor group, for the 'Serious Games for Cybersecurity' exam.

To start the game, click on:
•	TheRebuilder.bat for Windows
•	TheRebuilder.command for MacOS

The script try to find the the Web Browser to open the html file (to avoid opening the IDE, in certain cases, clicking directly on the index.html file). In certain case the script can fail when not find an eligibile Web Browser (from the list of the browser in the script): in that case the file will be open with the default program to open .html, so simply drag and drop the .html in another browser to start the game.

Warning! All files must be placed in the same folder for the game to work properly.
